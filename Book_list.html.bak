        <h1>My recommended top book series I have read in the past few years</h1>
		  <h2>Red rising</h2>
            <p>The red rising series is one of my favorite modern science fiction series, Red Rising as a science fiction series written by Pierce Brown<br>
		    a New York Times bestselling author. I would describe the series as a futuristic sci-fi dystopian where the your position in society is based off a color-coded caste system</br>.
		    Our main character Darrow is a red, a member of the lowest rank in the caste system. He works all day believing that he and his people are making a difference for the future<br>
		    of Mars, but he and his people have been lied to longing for justice Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate Gold Society, the highest in the caste system. </br>
		    There are currently five books in the series with a 6th on on the way very soon. </p>
