        <h1>My recommended top book series I have read in the past few years</h1>
		  <h2> The Red rising Series</h2>
            <p>The red rising series is one of my favorite modern science fiction series, Red Rising as a science fiction series written by Pierce Brown<br>
		    a New York Times bestselling author. I would describe the series as a futuristic sci-fi dystopian where the your position in society is based off a color-coded caste system</br>.
		    Our main character Darrow is a red, a member of the lowest rank in the caste system. He works all day believing that he and his people are making a difference for the future<br>
		    of Mars, but he and his people have been lied to longing for justice Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate Gold Society, the highest in the caste system. </br>
		    There are currently five books in the series with a 6th on on the way very soon. </p>

		  <h2>The Murderbot Diaires</h2>
		      <p>The Murderbot Diaries series by Martha Well's is about an artificial construct built to be security unit that self hacks its Governor module enabling independence.<br> 
			  Murderbot spends it's days mostly watching soap operas and downloading media from it's feed. it could care less for real humans and prefers the ones it sees in it's soap </br>
			  operas though as it spends more time with other beings both artificial and human it starts to develops emotional connections as well as friendships which murderbot<br>
			  would describe as inconvenient. What I like about this series is Murderbot's self-deprecating humor and some very surprising touching moments which I was actually  not</br>
			  expecting from a series about an artificial construct. Another benefit of the series is if you don't like reading long books the first four books in the series are<br>
			  all very short novellas that can be read within a few days with only one full novel (the fifth book in the series) in this currently ongoing 6 book series</br>

		  <h2>The Green Bone Sage</h2>
		    <p>The green bone Saga by Fonda Lee is a series of three books starting with the Jade City then the Jade War and concluding with the Jade Legacy. I would describe this as 
			   a Godfather trilogy that takes place in a mythical like Hong Kong where Jade has power. Unlike The Godfather each subsequent novel gets better and better, by the end of the 
			   trilogy I was emotional and realized I was reading a modern masterpiece. If you like magic and Kung Fu this is the book series for you.</p>
